# ACPaaS UI Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to ACPaaS UI. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

- [ACPaaS UI Contributing Guide](#acpaas-ui-contributing-guide)
    - [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
    - [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
    - [Development Setup](#development-setup)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- If you're not yet a member of our DigAnt CafÃ© slack community, you can easily [join here](https://digantcafe-slack.digipolis.be).
- Use the [#acpaas-ui channel](https://digantcafe.slack.com/messages/CDDLYJU65/) on slack to ask questions about using ACPaaS UI.
- Use the [#acpaas-ui-ngx channel][acpaas-ui-ngx] on slack to discuss changes to the ACPaaS UI code itself.
- Use [GitHub Issues][github-issues] to report bugs, request features, ask policy questions or propose policy changes.

> Note: policy questions are about the way ACPaaS UI is developed and released, or about its architecture. We use github issues to have a public archive of these discussions.
>
> Maintainers: check the [issue handling guidelines](./guidelines/ISSUES.md) for how to handle reported issues.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is where we ship releases from. Always send PRs to `master`.

- Commit your changes to a topic branch with a name matching these examples:
    - `feature/more-cowbell`
    - `fix/broken-cowbell`
    - `docs/document-cowbell`
    - For a list of suggested keywords, check the [commit message convention](./guidelines/COMMITS.md).

- Work in the `packages` folder and **DO NOT** check in the top-level `dist` and `examples` folders in the commits.

- Commits must follow the [commit message convention](./guidelines/COMMITS.md). It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we can let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes.

- If adding a new feature:
    - Add an accompanying test case.
    - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/acpaas-ui_angular/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
    - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR or an accompanying [bug report issue](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/acpaas-ui_angular/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) linked from the PR (recommended).
    - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

- For additional guidance while developing, check the [dev guide](./guidelines/DEV_GUIDE.md).

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 8+**.

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
# install dependencies needed for the bootstrap command
$ npm install # or yarn
# install nested package.json dependencies
$ npm run bootstrap
# build into dist folder
$ npm run build
```

Additionally, to run the examples locally:

```bash
# update the styleguide from the individual components
$ npm run examples
# run the styleguide examples application
$ npm run styleguide
```

## Project Structure

- `dist`: contains the build output for the components
- `examples`: contains the build output for the examples
- `packages`: the component sources
    - `some-package/`: sources for a component package (one or more components)
        - Use `npm run package some-other-package` to create a new package folder
        - `lib/src/some-component/`: sources for a component
        - `examples/`: examples (documentation) as shown in the styleguide app
        - `package.json`: dependencies needed by this package
        - `README.md`: documentation for this package, linked from the main [README.md](README.md)
- `scripts`: helper shell scripts used by the npm tasks
- `styleguide`: sources for the examples web app (but not the actual examples)

## Releases

ACPaaS UI is supplied as a single library on NPM [@acpaas-ui/ngx-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acpaas-ui/ngx-components), although related components (e.g. the [smart widgets](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/smart-widgets)) may be packaged independently.

It is released at least once a month, and more often if there are high priority changes. If your PR has been merged but not yet released, and it is high priority, please ping the [#acpaas-ui-ngx channel][acpaas-ui-ngx] to ask for an out-of-band release. (Before you do so, check the [dev guide](./guidelines/DEV_GUIDE.md#development-snapshots) for ways to use it without an official release.)

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The latest stable major version is developed on the `master` branch. For other major versions there are separate `vX-dev` branches. For more info on the exact versioning policy, see the [versioning guide](./guidelines/VERSIONING.md).

A [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is provided for your convenience.

> Maintainers: see the [release guide](./guidelines/RELEASE.md) for guidance on releases and versioning.
